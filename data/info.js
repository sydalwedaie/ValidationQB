The answers listed in this document are a representation of the information extracted from official Gulf Air operational documentation but may not necessarily be up-to-date with the latest revisions to those documents.",
	"policies" : "Each pilot must be able to correctly answer (not necessarily word for word) at least 80% of the questions posed by the facilitator during an oral knowledge validation session. During the allotted time period of the knowledge validation, the TRE-V is permitted to train the pilot to proficiency in any knowledge areas found to be deficient.<br>For complete policies and procedures related to Oral Knowledge Validations, see Gulf Air Operations Manual Part D (OM-D) Volume 2, <em>AQP Training Manual</em>, Chapter 4, Section 3.",
	"limitations" : "The limitation questions listed here represent all of the limitations that must be committed to memory. In addition, other limitations are listed on placards in the cockpit or listed on other operational documentation readily accessible to the flight crew. Moreover, Gulf Air pilots should be operationally familiar with the many other aircraft limitations listed in the Operating Limitations Chapter of the applicable FCOM 3.",
	"memory" : "The questions listed here represent the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and FCOM 3 immediate action procedures (Memory Items) that must be committed to memory. When asked these questions during a knowledge validation event, Gulf Air pilots must be able to immediately recite these procedures, in the proper sequence, without errors. In addition, there are many other flight operational procedures that must be carried out in a timely manner. Gulf Air pilots should be operationally familiar with the many other emergency and abnormal procedures listed in the applicable QRH.",
